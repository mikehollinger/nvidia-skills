# Deploy Behavior Analytics — Standalone Service

Deploy **just** `vss-behavior-analytics` (no agent, no perception, no UI) — useful when you want to:

- Run a behavior-analytics pipeline against an existing broker (or no broker at all).
- Pick a different entrypoint (analytics 2D / 3D, search_and_alerts) without modifying the image.

Required host runtime: **Docker Engine 28.3.3** with **Docker Compose plugin v2.39.1+**.

---

## What you edit

You only edit the existing service compose:

```
<repo>/deploy/docker/services/analytics/behavior-analytics/compose.yml
```

1. **`command:`** — which app entrypoint to run.
2. **`volumes:`** — what config (required) and what calibration (optional) to mount.
3. The `--config` and optional `--calibration` flags inside the same `command:` line.

Walk steps 1-4 below to decide each one; the bring-it-up command lives in [Deploy + verify](#deploy--verify) at the end.

---

## Step 1 — Pick an entrypoint

Set the first half of `command:` to one of the following:

| Entrypoint | Class | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/analytics/main_analytics_2d_app.py` | `Analytics2DApp` | 2D spatial pipeline — operates on **(X, Y) world-plane coordinates** lifted from the image plane via per-sensor homography. Two parallel processors: **behavior creation** (object tracking → behavior + ROI / tripwire / proximity events, plus map-matching) and **frame enhancement** (calibration transform → per-frame state → FOV-count / restricted-area / confined-area incidents). **The default.** |
| `apps/analytics/main_analytics_3d_app.py` | `Analytics3DApp` | Operates on **full (X, Y, Z) 3D world coordinates** — fed from upstream multi-view 3D tracking (mv3dt) that produces 3D bounding boxes. Same two processors as 2D (with the 3D calibration class), plus a third **space-analyzer** processor that estimates space utilization per region on a periodic interval. Use this for 3D warehouse / multi-view 3D tracking (mv3dt). |
| `apps/search_and_alerts/main_search_and_alerts_app.py` | `SearchAndAlertsApp` | Three processors, each registered only if its worker count is non-zero: **incident generation** (`numWorkersForIncidentGeneration`) — calibration transform → per-frame state → FOV-count / restricted-area / confined-area / proximity incidents; **behavior creation** (`numWorkersForBehaviorCreation`) — object tracking from raw frames, including ROI / tripwire events; **embedding downsampling** (`numWorkersForEmbedFiltering`) — reads chunked video embeddings and writes the survivors. The three modes are just which counts you set: all three = search + alerts; `numWorkersForIncidentGeneration=0` = search only (`dev-profile-search`); `numWorkersForBehaviorCreation=0` + `numWorkersForEmbedFiltering=0` = alerts only (`dev-profile-alerts`). |
| `apps/smart_city/main_smart_city_app.py` | `SmartCityApp` | Geo-oriented pipeline for street/city scenes. **Behavior creation** (`numWorkersForBehaviorCreation`) with anomaly detection built **unconditionally** — unlike every other entrypoint there is no `anomalyDetectionEnable` gate, so speed/stop anomalies and the road-network CRS load are always paid for. Collision detection is opt-in via the sensor `collisionDetection.enable` block and writes collision incidents. A second **behavior clustering** processor (`numWorkersForBehaviorClustering`) registers only when the config's `inference.enable` is `true` — worker count alone is not enough here, which differs from `CompositeApp`. **Constraints:** both worker counts are read with no fallback, so a config omitting either key crashes at startup with `ValueError: invalid literal for int()`; the shipped `smart_city_config.json` / `smart_city_config_image.json` set them (4 and 2) with `inference.enable: false`. |
| `apps/composite/main_composite_app.py` | `CompositeApp` | **Last resort — prefer one of the apps above.** It is the heavyweight option: it constructs every capability's state (behavior state, frame state, ROI/tripwire generators, space analyzer, embedding state) at startup regardless of which processors you enabled, and the enabled ones are CPU-hungry per batch. Reproducing a shipped profile through it costs more than running that profile's own entrypoint for identical output. Pick it **only** when the capability set you want does not exist as a single shipped app. Every capability in one app, each registered only if its worker count is non-zero: **behavior creation** (`numWorkersForBehaviorCreation`), **frame enhancement** (`numWorkersForFrameEnhancement`), **space estimation** (`numWorkersForSpaceEstimation`), **embedding downsampling** (`numWorkersForEmbedFiltering`), **behavior clustering** (`numWorkersForBehaviorClustering`). These come from different per-profile apps and can be combined freely, which no other entrypoint allows. Detection stages inside behavior creation are opt-in: `anomalyDetectionEnable`, `actionDetectionEnable`, `collisionDetection.enable`. **Constraints:** space estimation needs cartesian 3D and silently produces nothing otherwise; clustering needs a Triton `inference` block; run only one behavior producer per deployment. |

**Which topics each processor needs.** A destination the config omits is a *disabled output*, not an error: the
sink logs `No destination configured for '<key>'` once and drops the rest, so an unconfigured topic looks like an
empty stream. Define every key a processor you enabled writes to. Each entry is `{"name": "<key>", "value":
"<broker topic/stream name>"}` under `kafka.topics` (or `redisStream.streams` / `mqtt.topics`).

| Processor (worker key) | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| behavior creation (`numWorkersForBehaviorCreation`) | `raw` | `behavior`, `events`, and — only where the app runs detection — `anomaly`, `incidents` |
| frame enhancement / incident generation (`numWorkersForFrameEnhancement`, or `numWorkersForIncidentGeneration` in search_and_alerts) | `raw` | `frames`, `incidents` |
| space estimation (`numWorkersForSpaceEstimation`) | `raw` | `spaceUtilization` |
| embedding downsampling (`numWorkersForEmbedFiltering`) | `embed` | `embedFiltered` |
| behavior clustering (`numWorkersForBehaviorClustering`) | `behavior` | `behaviorPlus` |

`notification` is also needed if you want dynamic config or calibration at runtime — that is the topic both
listeners consume.

**ROI ENTRY/EXIT detection mode.** `roiEventDetectionMode` defaults to `"coordinate"` (the object's representative point must fall inside the ROI polygon). `"bbox"` — overlap of the object's bounding box with the polygon — is honored **only for image calibration**, where `object.bbox` and the ROI share image-pixel coordinates. Under cartesian or geo calibration the bbox is in pixels while the ROI is in world units, so it silently falls back to the coordinate test with a one-time warning. Pick an entrypoint you would actually run image-calibrated if you need bbox mode.

**mv3dt** uses `main_analytics_3d_app.py` (the multi-view 3D tracker is a perception-side variant — the analytics pipeline is the same as 3D). There is no separate `main_mv3dt_app.py`.

---

## Step 2 — Choose a config (required)

Every entrypoint requires `--config <path>`. The container has two viable sources:

### Option A — Use a profile's existing config

If you want the behavior/topic/sensor wiring a specific blueprint uses (already tuned to its dataset), point the volume mount at one of the profile-shipped configs and reference the mounted path on the `--config` flag.

Recommended pairings (entrypoint → existing config):

| Entrypoint | Recommended existing config |
|---|---|
| `main_analytics_2d_app.py` | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-2d-app/vss-behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json` |
| `main_analytics_3d_app.py` | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-3d-app/vss-behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json` |
| `main_analytics_3d_app.py` (mv3dt) | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-mv3dt-app/vss-behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json` |
| `main_search_and_alerts_app.py` (search + alerts) | Use the shipped repository-root `services/analytics/behavior-analytics/configs/search_and_alerts_config.json`. It is outside `VSS_APPS_DIR` (`deploy/docker`), so mount it by absolute host path as in Option B. Copy and edit it only for bespoke topic mappings or worker counts. |
| `main_search_and_alerts_app.py` (alerts only) | `developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/vss-behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json` (behavior + embed workers set to `0`) |
| `main_search_and_alerts_app.py` (search only) | `developer-profiles/dev-profile-search/video-analytics-2d-app/vss-search-analytics/configs/vss-search-analytics-<stream>-config.json` (incident-generation workers set to `0`) |
| `main_smart_city_app.py` | No profile ships one. Start from the service's own `configs/smart_city_config.json` (geo calibration) or `configs/smart_city_config_image.json` (image calibration) and mount it as a custom config (Option B). |
| `main_composite_app.py` | No profile ships one. `configs/composite_config.json` is a starter that defines every topic but sets every `numWorkersFor*` to `0` — copy it and set the counts you want, or the app exits immediately (see Troubleshooting). |

Compose change:

```yaml
services:
  vss-behavior-analytics-base:
    volumes:
      - $VSS_APPS_DIR/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-3d-app/vss-behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json:/resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
    command: python3 apps/analytics/main_analytics_3d_app.py --config /resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
```

### Option B — Use your own custom config

Drop in any absolute host path; copy one of the above as a starting point and edit. Compose change is identical to Option A but with `/abs/path/to/my-config.json` as the bind source.

```yaml
volumes:
  - /abs/path/to/my-config.json:/resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
command: python3 apps/analytics/main_analytics_2d_app.py --config /resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
```

### Config — what's in it

Top-level shape (every config has all of these):

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `kafka` / `redisStream` / `mqtt` | Broker host, topics, consumer/producer tuning. `sourceType` / `sinkType` in the `app[]` section pick which one is actually used. |
| `app[]` | List of `{name, value}` strings. Knobs like `behaviorWatermarkSec`, `numWorkersForBehaviorCreation`, `stateManagementFilter`, `clusterThreshold`, `trajDirectionMode`, plus per-incident-type toggles (`fovCountViolationIncidentEnable`, `restrictedAreaViolationIncidentEnable`, etc.). |
| `sensors[]` | Per-sensor entries with `{id, configs: [{name, value}]}` — per-sensor overrides for things like `tripwireMinPoints`, `proximityDetectionEnable`, `anomalySpeedViolation`. |

Higher-level docs:

- `configuration.md` — config field guide.

---

## Step 3 — Choose a calibration (optional)

Calibration tells the app the sensor map, ROIs, tripwires, geo-locations, homographies, etc. It's **optional** at startup.

### Calibration types

The type is encoded in the calibration JSON itself, on the top-level `calibrationType` field. There are three values:

| `calibrationType` | Class | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `"cartesian"` | `CalibrationE` | **Typical for warehouse / smart-city.** Maps image-plane coordinates (pixels) to real-world Cartesian metres via the per-sensor homography (`imageCoordinates[]` ↔ `globalCoordinates[]`). All downstream behavior creation, ROI / tripwire / proximity / space-analytics math is in metres. **Recommended starting point.** |
| `"geo"` | `Calibration` | Maps image coordinates to geographic lat/lng. Use when sensors are placed against a real map (OSM, GIS) and you want behaviors / events anchored to GPS. |
| `"image"` | `CalibrationI` | No real-world mapping — keeps coordinates in raw pixel space. The downstream pipeline still runs, but distance / speed / area numbers are in pixels, not metres, and most metric-based incident thresholds become meaningless. |

### What happens if you skip calibration

Don't add a `--calibration` flag and don't mount one. The app starts with a `DynamicCalibration` wrapper that initially behaves as `CalibrationI` (image-plane). It then:

1. **Watches `mdx-notification`** for the first `calibrationType` notification. When one arrives, the wrapper switches itself to the typed subclass (`CalibrationE` / `Calibration` / `CalibrationI`) inferred from the payload's `calibrationType`. After the switch, all subsequent updates go through the typed instance via the same Kafka flow.
2. **Until that first notification arrives**, frames are processed with image-plane coordinates — effectively a no-op for analytics (no real-world distances, no ROI/tripwire firings against a map). If you don't intend to wire a producer for dynamic calibration, supply a static calibration file instead.

### Pick a calibration source

- **Use one of the profile-shipped calibrations.** Same pattern as config Option A:

  | Entrypoint | Recommended existing calibration |
  |---|---|
  | `main_analytics_2d_app.py` | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-2d-app/calibration/sample-data/<dataset>/calibration.json` |
  | `main_analytics_3d_app.py` | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-3d-app/calibration/sample-data/<dataset>/calibration.json` |
  | `main_analytics_3d_app.py` (mv3dt) | `industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/warehouse-mv3dt-app/calibration/sample-data/<dataset>/calibration.json` |
  | `main_search_and_alerts_app.py` | the search / alerts profiles may not need one. |
- **Bring your own.** Any absolute host path that conforms to the calibration JSON schema. If you're hand-rolling one, start from the `"cartesian"` type — that's the path the rest of the pipeline is tuned for.

  Compose change:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - $VSS_APPS_DIR/services/analytics/behavior-analytics/configs/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json:/resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
    - /abs/path/to/calibration.json:/resources/calibration.json   # or a profile sample-data path
  command: >
    python3 apps/analytics/main_analytics_2d_app.py
    --config /resources/vss-behavior-analytics-config.json
    --calibration /resources/calibration.json
  ```

The schema for the calibration JSON is vendored from `video-analytics-api/src/web-api-core/schemas/ajv/calibration.json` and lives at `behavior-analytics/src/mdx/analytics/core/transform/calibration/schemas/calibration.schema.json`.

---

## Step 4 — Broker (not required to launch)

> **Standalone caveat — point `brokers` at a reachable address first.** The shipped configs set the broker to a **Docker DNS service name** — `kafka.brokers: "kafka:29092"` (and `redisStream.host: "redis"`) — which only resolves **inside the VSS compose network**, where those broker services run. Deploying `vss-behavior-analytics` on its own (this skill's whole point) puts it on a lone bridge network where the name `kafka` does **not** resolve, so it can never connect. Before bring-up, edit the config JSON's `brokers` / `host` to a reachable `host:port` for your actual broker (or attach the container to the broker's Docker network). The default DNS names are correct only when BA runs alongside the broker in the same compose project.

`vss-behavior-analytics` does **not** require a broker to be present at start time:

- The container starts fine without Kafka/Redis/MQTT reachable.
- The Kafka client retries the broker connection (with backoff) at whatever `kafka.brokers` is set to (shipped default `kafka:29092`). You'll see repeated connection warnings in `docker logs behavior-analytics-vss-behavior-analytics-base-1` while it tries — `Connection refused` if the address resolves but nothing is listening, or a **name-resolution failure** if the DNS name (`kafka`) can't resolve, which is the standalone-with-default-config case the caveat above prevents. (The auto-generated container name comes from Compose's default `<project>-<service>-<index>` pattern; project name defaults to the compose file's parent directory, `behavior-analytics`.)
- Once retries are exhausted, the app process exits and the container's `restart: always` policy brings it back up. The new container starts a fresh retry cycle. This restart loop continues — visible in `docker ps` as the `Status` column counting `Restarting (N)` — until the broker becomes reachable, at which point the consumer thread connects on the next attempt and drains messages normally.

Practical implication: a broker-less analytics container is **not** sitting idle in-process — it's cycling. Fine for "bring up analytics first, broker later" workflows, but expect periodic restarts in the meantime. If you want it to fail-fast instead (e.g. in CI), override `restart:` to `on-failure` or `no`, or wrap with your own healthcheck.

> When a broker **is** reachable, you also get two runtime-update flows — dynamic config and dynamic calibration — that don't require redeploying the container. Those are post-deployment operations and live in the `SKILL.md`'s **Dynamic updates** section, plus `dynamic-config.md` and `dynamic-calibration.md` for full wire contracts.

## Deploy + verify

```bash
cd <repo>/deploy/docker
docker --version        # need 28.3.3
docker compose version  # need v2.39.1+

export VSS_APPS_DIR=$(pwd)

# (one-time) edit services/analytics/behavior-analytics/compose.yml — entrypoint, config volume, optional calibration volume.

docker compose -f services/analytics/behavior-analytics/compose.yml up -d vss-behavior-analytics-base

docker ps --filter "name=vss-behavior-analytics" --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
# Compose auto-names the container <project>-<service>-<index>; project defaults to
# the compose file's parent dir, so the full name is:
docker logs -f behavior-analytics-vss-behavior-analytics-base-1
```

Healthy log lines include:

```
[Analytics2DApp] starting with N worker processes
[CalibrationListener] subscribed to mdx-notification (key=calibration)
[ConfigListener] request-config published (bootstrap_ref=behavior-analytics-<uuid>)
```

If you skipped calibration, you'll also see:

```
DynamicCalibration: no --calibration provided; waiting for first calibration notification...
```

## Teardown

```bash
docker compose -f services/analytics/behavior-analytics/compose.yml down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `FileNotFoundError: '/resources/...'` on startup | `--config` flag and the volume bind target don't match. | Make the `--config` path equal the container side of the volume bind (the part after the `:`). |
| `docker ps` shows the container in a `Restarting (N)` loop, logs print `Connect to … failed: Connection refused` then exit | No broker listening on the host. Retries are exhausted, app exits, `restart: always` brings it back, repeat. | Expected if you're intentionally running broker-less; otherwise start your broker — the next restart cycle will connect. To stop the restart loop, override `restart:` to `on-failure` or `no`. |
| `calibration schema violation` after a notification arrives | Producer sent a payload that fails the JSON Schema gate. | Previously-good calibration stays loaded; check the producer's payload against the schema in `src/mdx/analytics/core/transform/calibration/schemas/calibration.schema.json`. |
| `dropping config message: unrecognized reference-id …` | Inbound dynamic-config `upsert` / `upsert-all` carries a reference-id outside the accepted set. | Reference-id must start with `video-analytics-api-` (web-api), `behavior-analytics-` (bootstrap echo), or equal the active source-type literal (`kafka` / `redis` / `mqtt`). |
| `dropping config message: no config to update` | Inbound `upsert` had `config: null` or omitted the field. | An `upsert` with no config is a producer bug; `upsert-all` with `config=null` is allowed (it's the bootstrap-failure signal). |
| Workers fall behind / `Avg processing speed` very low | Worker count too low for the input rate. | Increase `numWorkersForBehaviorCreation` (and `numWorkersForFrameEnhancement` / `numWorkersForSpaceEstimation` for 3D) in the config's `app[]` section. |
